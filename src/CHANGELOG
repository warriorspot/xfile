9/5/2009
- Fixed crash if you type a field name in View Field As List that does not exist.
- Added simple table based HTML export. Man, that export code is a mess.
- Added View Database As HTML, which runs the HTML export to a temp file, then
  loads the file in the HTMLViewer program defined in the config file.  So, you
  will want to add a line HTMLViewer = "whatever program" to your xfile.cfg file.
  A neat thing is that Excel, and probably any other modern spreadsheet will import
  the HTML nicely into a spreadsheet.
- If you are in design mode, and chose Run Bitmap Editor, if you have a static image 
  selected, that static image will be passed as the first argument to your bitmap editor.
  If you modify the image, you can select Layout | Reload Current to see the changes.
  
** PENDING KNOWN ISSUES (incomplete list)
2. The multiline text field doesnt resize automatically when the font is changed
4. On occassion, the ruler draws beyond its bounds.
6. Field validation is done, but ignored, during field re-ordering.
8. The whole number validation thing is half-baked and needs to be redone
9. Default font when creating field is different than default when reading back in from layout.
   This might be XBasics fault.
10. When re-loading fields after re-ordering the database, sometimes the program claims there
    is an error in the .geo file, but it loads fine if you open it manually
11. If an image is set that exceeds the current page size, you cant move the image.  You
    have to resize the page to accomodate the image, or set a different image
